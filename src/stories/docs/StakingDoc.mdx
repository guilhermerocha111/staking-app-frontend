# Description

Rewards generated per block

# Stake Amount

“Free to choose”, each stake entry will create a Vesting panel locked period and rewards are calculated for that specific staked amount.

# Stake Lock Periods - Token Weight - Yield

<ul>
    <li>1 month - 0.33X - (Rewards Per Year / Total Weight of all Staked Tokens) x 0.33 x100</li>
    <li>3 month - 1.0X - (Rewards Per Year / Total Weight of all Staked Tokens) x 100</li>
    <li>6 month - 2.0X -  (Rewards Per Year / Total Weight of all Staked Tokens) x 2 x 100 </li>
    <li>12 month - 4.0X - (Rewards Per Year / Total Weight of all Staked Tokens) x 4 x 100</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oLOEcXMWoc8biZkCS8kMiaC3hIgYfIrAR-ERD64ELKs/edit#gid=788558087" target="_blank">See example here</a>

`Yield per Block per token staked = (Rewards generated per block / total weight of all staked SMCW tokens) * token weight`

`APR = (Token Rewards per Year / Total Weight of all Staked Tokens) * Token Weight * 100`

# How it works:

Every time a user stakes, choosing a lock period is needed.
Depending on the selected period, the rewards earned are different, the more time you lock up for the more you earn (stated at the weighted rewards document above).

After SMCW stake, the remaining lock period will be represented at the Vesting panel with its own countdown and timestamp as well as the other info.

After the lock period expires, the Vesting panel will show a button with “Unstake”

After the unstake, the tokens are automatically sent to the user wallet.
The entry updates showing the “claimed” and “View Transaction”.

<span>Claiming Rewards:</span> Users rewards are shown accumulating in the Info Panel. Users must click the “VEST” button, at which point the rewards will vest for 1 month before they are claimable. 

<span className="tip">Users can only “VEST” once per week. Every time they VEST they can not do it again for 7 days. A countdown will be displayed under the VEST button.</span>
